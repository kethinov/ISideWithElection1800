# I Side With - Election 1800
An imitation of [ISideWith.com](https://isidewith.com) for the election of 1800.

See a running example [here](http://kethinov.com/election1800.php).

# Would love some help!

If you know some history and would like to expand the question set, please reach out to me and file an issue! I'd also enjoy making similar versions of this for different historic election years, or some help sprucing up the design.
